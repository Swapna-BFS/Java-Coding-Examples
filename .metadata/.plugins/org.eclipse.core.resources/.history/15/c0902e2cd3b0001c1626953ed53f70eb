Armstrong Number is a positive number if it is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits is called Armstrong number and if its sum is not equal to the number then its not a Armstrong number. Armstrong Number Program is very popular in java, c language, python etc. Examples: 153 is Armstrong, (1*1*1)+(5*5*5)+(3*3*3) = 153

Automorphic Number Program in Java
An Automorphic number is a number whose square “ends” in the same digits as the number itself. Examples: 5*5 = 25, 6*6 = 36, 25*25 = 625

Buzz Number Program in Java

CoPrime Numbers Program in Java
Two integers a and b are said to be relatively prime, mutually prime, or coprime if the only positive integer that divides both of them is 1. Example: 13 and 15 are co prime."
